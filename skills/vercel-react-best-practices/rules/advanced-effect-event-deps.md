## Do Not Put Effect Events in Dependency Arrays

Effect Event functions lack a stable identity — by design, their identity changes on every render. Never include the function returned by `useEffectEvent` in a `useEffect` dependency array. List only the truly reactive values as dependencies, and invoke the Effect Event from within the effect body or any subscriptions the effect creates.

**Incorrect (Effect Event added as a dependency):**

```tsx
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react'

function ChatRoom({ roomId, onConnected }: {
  roomId: string
  onConnected: () => void
}) {
  const handleConnected = useEffectEvent(onConnected)

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId)
    connection.on('connected', handleConnected)
    connection.connect()

    return () => connection.disconnect()
  }, [roomId, handleConnected])
}
```

Adding the Effect Event to the dependency array causes the effect to re-run on every render and violates the React Hooks lint rule.

**Correct (depend on reactive values, not the Effect Event):**

```tsx
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react'

function ChatRoom({ roomId, onConnected }: {
  roomId: string
  onConnected: () => void
}) {
  const handleConnected = useEffectEvent(onConnected)

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(roomId)
    connection.on('connected', handleConnected)
    connection.connect()

    return () => connection.disconnect()
  }, [roomId])
}
```
