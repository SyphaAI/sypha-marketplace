## Use Functional setState Updates

When new state depends on the current state value, pass an updater function to setState rather than reading the state variable directly. This approach eliminates stale closures, removes unnecessary dependencies, and produces stable callback references.

**Incorrect (requires state as dependency):**

```tsx
function TodoList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems)

  // Callback must depend on items, recreated on every items change
  const addItems = useCallback((newItems: Item[]) => {
    setItems([...items, ...newItems])
  }, [items])  // ❌ items dependency causes recreations

  // Risk of stale closure if dependency is forgotten
  const removeItem = useCallback((id: string) => {
    setItems(items.filter(item => item.id !== id))
  }, [])  // ❌ Missing items dependency - will use stale items!

  return <ItemsEditor items={items} onAdd={addItems} onRemove={removeItem} />
}
```

The first callback is recreated every time `items` changes, which can cause child components to re-render unnecessarily. The second callback has a stale closure bug—it will always reference the initial `items` value.

**Correct (stable callbacks, no stale closures):**

```tsx
function TodoList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems)

  // Stable callback, never recreated
  const addItems = useCallback((newItems: Item[]) => {
    setItems(curr => [...curr, ...newItems])
  }, [])  // ✅ No dependencies needed

  // Always uses latest state, no stale closure risk
  const removeItem = useCallback((id: string) => {
    setItems(curr => curr.filter(item => item.id !== id))
  }, [])  // ✅ Safe and stable

  return <ItemsEditor items={items} onAdd={addItems} onRemove={removeItem} />
}
```

**Benefits:**

1. **Stable callback references** - Callbacks no longer need to be recreated each time state changes
2. **No stale closures** - The updater function always receives the most recent state value
3. **Fewer dependencies** - Dependency arrays become simpler and the risk of memory leaks drops
4. **Prevents bugs** - Removes the most common source of React closure-related bugs

**When to use functional updates:**

- Any setState that depends on the current state value
- Inside useCallback/useMemo when state is needed
- Event handlers that reference state
- Async operations that update state

**When direct updates are fine:**

- Setting state to a static value: `setCount(0)`
- Setting state from props/arguments only: `setName(newName)`
- State doesn't depend on previous value

**Note:** If your project has [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) enabled, the compiler can automatically optimize some cases, but functional updates are still recommended for correctness and to prevent stale closure bugs.
